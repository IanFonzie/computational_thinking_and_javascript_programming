// console output

// There are 5 positive words in the text.
// Positive sentiments: fortune, dream, respect, love, resolution

// There are 6 negative words in the text.
// Negative sentiments: die, heartache, die, death, weary, death

// The sentiment of the text is Negative.

// abstractions: 
// Need to filter the list for words that are positive.
// we then take the count of this and the join of the words.

// we repeat this for the negative words.

// We have a function that formats our responses and a function that checks
// whether the overall text is positive or negative.

// Their Abstractions:

// Our solution should take the shape of a filter: we need to filter the text into two lists, one that contains positive words, 
// and one that contains negative words. Once we have these lists, an output summary is easy

// var wordList = text.toLowerCase().replace(/\n/g, ' ').replace(/[-:\.\!\,\?]/g, '').split(' ');

// This statement converts all characters to lowercase, replaces all the newline characters with spaces, removes special characters (-:.,!?),
// then splits the text into an array of words which it stores in wordList.

// I got pretty close, except I forgot to include the global keyword and escape a few of the special characters, though I don't know if this was
// 100% necessary for the ones they selected

// Their solution:

// function sentiment(text) {
//   var wordList = text.toLowerCase().replace(/\n/g, ' ').replace(/[\.\!\,\?]/g, '').split(' ');
//   var textSentiment;

//   var positives = wordList.filter(function(word) {
//     return positiveWords.indexOf(word) >= 0;
//   });

//   var negatives = wordList.filter(function(word) {
//     return negativeWords.indexOf(word) >= 0;
//   });

//   console.log('There are ' + positives.length + ' positive words in the text.');
//   console.log('Positive sentiments: ' + positives.join(', '));
//   console.log('');
//   console.log('There are ' + negatives.length + ' negative words in the text.');
//   console.log('Negative sentiments: ' + negatives.join(', '));
//   console.log('');

//   if (positives.length > negatives.length) {
//     textSentiment = 'Positive';
//   } else if (positives.length < negatives.length) {
//     textSentiment = 'Negative';
//   } else {
//     textSentiment = 'Neutral';
//   }

//   console.log('The sentinment of the text is ' + textSentiment + '.');
// }

// Solutions were actually quite similar. I felt my soluton was slightly more abstracted, their function was doing
// quite a bit. They also stored the sentiment in a variable whereas I moved that logic to the function and had it
// return a value that could be placed into the text. They also used indexOf >= 0, whereas I used includes.
